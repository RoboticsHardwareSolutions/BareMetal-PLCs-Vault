- [[BareMetal PLC M]]
- [[BareMetal PLC L]]
- [[BareMetal PLC XL]]
## Overview

Bare-metal PLC's Controllers has various powerful features and can service a wide range of applications. Software programming, and commissioning are achieved with the Cmake and C++ languages. To speed up development, you can use the **RLibs** from [here](https://github.com/RoboticsHardwareSolutions/.github/tree/main/profile#rlibs) . **RLibs** are libraries that provide a higher level of abstraction than HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layers). **Rlibs** it is PAL (Platform Abstraction Layer), they solve the most common problems when programming automation, robots, and more. 
## Main benefits 

The key advantage of Bare-metal PLC's over standard PLC's is the flexibility and convenience of software development. To create software, you can use ready-made project templates in which all the necessary libraries are connected. The controller is also equipped with step-by-step debugging and programming tools. Development can be carried out using a convenient operating system for you: Linux, macOS, Windows. For development, you can use the C/C++ languages. All development tools are cross-platform. You can also take advantage of CI/CD when developing your products, unlike standard PLCs.
